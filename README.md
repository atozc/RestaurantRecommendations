# Restaurant Recommender Web App

A client-side React application, utilizing the Yelp API to search for local businesses. It allows users to search a restaurant by location and sort it by best match, highest rated, and distance. This was a guided project that was completed as part of Codecademy's 'Create a Front-End App with React' skill path.

## Local Setup

### `npm install`

Install all of the Node dependencies for React and other third party packages used in this project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode via `node server.js`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits to the source code. You will also see any linting errors in the console.

### `npm serve`

Builds the app via `npm run build`. This is similar to `npm start`, except for a production build rather than development. Unlike the `start` command, any changes made after running `serve` will not be incorporated. The emulator will have to be terminated and restarted to see changes. Used to test that everything is working as expected prior to deployment.
